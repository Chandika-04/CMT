  Dear {{ object.user }},
</p>
<p align="justify">
  It is my duty to notify you of the action of the Theta Tau Executive
  Council expelling you from Theta Tau membership. This followed
  action by your chapter to suspend you and recommend your
  expulsion.
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you have not already done so, you are asked now to return your
badge, other insignia, manual, shingle, etc.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You are reminded of your oath of membership in which you
promised to keep secret all that was disclosed to you even if
expelled at some future date.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Theta Tau Bylaws provide that an expelled member may apply
for reinstatement by petition to the Grand Regent accompanied by
such evidence as he may care to present to support his petition.
</p>
<p>
Yours very truly,
</p>
