      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      Chapter Officers (or Risk Management Chair) will organize chapter
      participation at least once per year in each of the following areas. The
      chapterâ€™s university office of student affairs (or other similar
      department) likely has information and/or facilitators for each of these
      areas:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Alcohol and drug awareness program to educate its members on the
          responsibilities and consequences of alcohol consumption and drug use;
        </li>
        <li>
          Anti-harassment program to assist members in recognizing, preventing,
          and reporting discrimination, sexual harassment, and hazing;
        </li>
        <li>
          Mental health recognition program (such as suicide or depression) to
          help members in the recognition of warning signs, identification of
          referral resources, and skills to respond to members at-risk.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These programs must be conducted by a qualified professional (eg. a
        campus police officer, a healthcare professional, a substance abuse
        counselor, etc) and that professional must provide a letter, on their
        letterhead, stipulating the training they provided. They must also
        indicate the date and location of the training and the number of student
        members in attendance. That form should be uploaded below. The Central
        Office will verify that the letter is acceptable and mark your
        programming requirement as completed.
      </p>
