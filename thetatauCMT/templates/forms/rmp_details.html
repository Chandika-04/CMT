      </li>
      <li>
        Each chapter is encouraged to regularly participate in an alcohol and drug awareness program at the chapter’s University to educate its members on the personal consequences of drug abuse as well as how such use affects each individual chapter and the national Fraternity.

  <h3>Policy on High-Risk Events</h3>
    Theta Tau cannot condone and discourages participation in high-risk events. Examples of high-risk events include, but are not limited to: Bungee jumping, parachuting, sporting events such as boxing, etc. Individuals choosing to take part in these sorts of events do so at their own risk and with the full understanding of the inherent risks associated with them.

          {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
<hr />
  <h3>Policy on Transportation</h3>
    Theta Tau chapters are encouraged to establish a transportation policy for chapter events which are not held at or within walking distance from the chapter facility. It is strongly recommended that the policy include the use of a form of mass transportation, such as charter buses, to transport members for such events, and particularly for events where alcohol may be consumed. When transportation is not arranged, alternative procedures, such as designated (in advance of the event) drivers, should be used.
    {% if form %}
      {{ form.transportation|as_crispy_field }}

      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
<hr />
  <h3>Policy on Property Management</h3>
    The chapter facility, along with its furnishings and landscape, are encouraged to provide for each member an environment for study, clean and safe living conditions, and recreation. Property should be maintained in a manner, which makes it inviting and attractive to parents, rushees, and alumni. A sound program focused on proper maintenance of the property, along with due regard for university, health, or fire department regulations, where applicable, shall be followed in each chapter. Rents and fees collected should be sufficient to meet not only annual expenses, but also sufficient to allow for savings toward significant renovations and/or new facilities.

    {% endif %}
<hr />
  <h3>Policy on Gun Safety</h3>
    Individuals choosing to exercise their right to bear arms should do so only after undergoing appropriate courses on gun safety and use sponsored and conducted by a reputable organization. The Fraternity generally believes that the chapter house is no place for a firearm and it should instead be stored safely elsewhere by the owner (such as a parent’s home or a firing range).  To prevent it from misuse or accidental use by its owner, another member, a guest, or an intruder, firearms kept on chapter premises shall be stored unloaded, in a locked storage area accessible only to the owner(s) of said firearms. Ammunition shall be stored in a separate locked area from the firearm. No loaded firearm shall be on Chapter premises. Notwithstanding the manner in which such a firearm is maintained or stored by its owner, firearms shall not be displayed, demonstrated, or cleaned on chapter premises or as part of any chapter activity.

  <h3>Trademark Policy</h3>
    The Fraternity name, letters, coat of arms, and various insignia are protected by trademark registration owned by Theta Tau   (the national Fraternity). The design or representation of the coat of arms, various insignia, Greek letters “??”, and the words “Theta Tau” are not to be manufactured, created, used or offered by sale by any person, company or firm except as specifically authorized by Theta Tau (the national Fraternity). The use of any text or design which casts Theta Tau in a negative light or is otherwise contrary to the ideals and values of Theta Tau, specifically including, but not limited to, materials deemed to be in conflict with Theta Tau’s Risk Management Policies, is prohibited. If instructed to do so by the national Fraternity, any entity will cease such use.
    </br>
    By virtue of their chapter charter or candidate chapter certificate, chapters and candidate chapters are permitted to use trademarked property only in furthering the mission of the organization, only in such manner as may be prescribed under our national laws, policies, or instructions, and only in a manner which reflects favorably upon Theta Tau. Permission for specific use will not be interpreted as general permission for continual or expanded use. The determination of appropriate use of Theta Tau’s trademarked property rests solely with Theta Tau (the national Fraternity). This policy will apply to any form, manner, or media in which trademarked property may appear or be rendered.

<hr />
  <h3>Website & Social Media Policy</h3>
    A chapter website and social media site should reflect the purpose and mission (Engineering Leaders for Service, Profession, and Brotherhood) of Theta Tau. Content and design should recognize that we have several different audiences who may view and use a site: prospective members, current student members, chapter alumni, parents and family of members, and university officials.
<ul>
  <li>
    Content must be appropriate, accurate, and portray Theta Tau favorably.
  </li>
  <li>
    Content on any website, social media page, group, or site must promote a positive image of the chapter (its pledges, members, and alumni), the national Fraternity, and the chapter’s host institution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Review Fraternity Risk Management Policy and Trademark Policy in developing and maintaining your site. Any page (including those showing policy violations) can be copied or saved, and screen shots of a site can be taken.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ritual information should never appear on a site or in any electronic communication (post, email, text, tweet, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    All photos, presentations, podcasts, artwork, audio, or video posted must be appropriate in nature and must adhere to the Risk Management and Trademark policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    If individual member pages, sites, or posts that are linked from chapter sites do not also comply with this policy, their site should be blocked, unlinked, or deleted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapters should promptly remove posts, messages, tweets, etc that do not adhere to this policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Appropriateness of content is the responsibility of the chapter but may be monitored by the national Fraternity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please review the related social media guidelines (for Facebook, Twitter, etc) on the Theta Tau website which provide additional suggestions and guidance
  </li>

  <h3>Indemnification, Authority, and Signatory Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Theta Tau (the national Fraternity) will not defend, nor indemnify, any college or university host institution against the institution’s own negligence. Chapters/Candidate Chapters, officers, members, advisers; alumni group members and officers; and house corporation members and officers are not officers of Theta Tau (the national Fraternity) and do not have authority to execute agreements, contracts, or documents on behalf of the Fraternity that would bind or otherwise obligate Theta Tau.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pursuant to the Federal Volunteer Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. §§1450-14505, college or university host institutions may not hold Theta Tau volunteers at any level liable for harm caused by a negligent act or omission of a volunteer acting within the scope of his responsibilities as a Theta Tau volunteer.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Grand Regent (national president) and Executive Director are the only officials who are authorized to sign contracts, agreements, or any other legal document on behalf of Theta Tau (the national Fraternity).
  </p>
  <p>
  Chapters, candidate chapters, alumni groups, and house corporations executing agreements for their respective entities must use their full name (e.g. Alpha Chapter of Theta Tau, National Capitol Alumni Club, Zeta House Corporation, Inc. ) on any contracts, agreements, or documents only after having received permission to do so under the laws and procedures of their respective local group. Chapters that receive requests that seek to bind the local group or indemnify another entity (such as the college, university, or athletic arena/venue) are instructed to contact the Central Office before executing any such agreement.

  <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
  <p>
    As the exclusive means of resolving disputes between an individual member and the Fraternity, the
    parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute through the use of non-binding mediation utilizing a
    mutually agreeable arbitrator, if one cannot be agreed upon then the parties agree that the
    American Arbitration Association shall appoint a mediator to conduct a non-binding mediation. In
    the event that mediation fails, the parties agree to submit any disputes arising out of this agreement
    to a binding resolution by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in
    accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and each party hereby consents to any such
    disputes being so resolved pursuant the Federal Arbitration Act as well as under any applicable
    state law and/or state contract law. Judgment on the award rendered in any such arbitration may
    be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

  <h3>Fines and Late Fees Schedule</h3>
  <p>
    I understand that, as a chapter officer, it is my responsibility to keep the Chapter Management Tool (CMT) up to
    date so that the Central Office can accurately invoice my chapter, and so that the National Fraternity can have
    information about the Fraternity’s general membership. I understand that, should I fail to report pledges in a
    timely manner, my chapter may be subject to a fine per pledge. I understand that, should I fail to report
    initiations in a timely manner, my chapter may be subject to a fine per member whose initiation is reported
    late. I understand that, should I fail to pay my chapter’s dues in a timely manner, without entering into a payment
    plan with the Central Office, my chapter may be subject to a late fee per member.
