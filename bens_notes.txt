Setup Instructions:
1. Get Docker
2. Start docker daemon
3. Run docker compose local (make sure you change all Postgres host and port references to "postgres" and "5432", respectively)
4. Run database migrations `python manage.py migrate`
5. Create a superuser `python manage.py createsuperuser`
6. Collect static files `python manage.py collectstatic`
7. Run command from DONT_FORGET_MIGRATION.txt (populates submission score types)
    * I think it's supposed to be loaddata though?
